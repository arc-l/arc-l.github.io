       In computer science, robotics, and control, a frequently encountered problem is verifying that an autonomous system is performing as designed. For example, a service robot may plan a path to clean office rooms one by one. Due to internal or external factors, the robot may mistaken one room for another and fail to accomplish its task without knowing that it has failed. In such cases, it is desirable if external means could automatically determine that a robot has faltered. In this research, we introduce realistic abstractions of above problems and show that such formulations are computationally tractable. In this work, we provide fast, dynamic programming based algorithms for verifying the path taken by an autonomous system by observing samples of the system's trajectory. Our algorithm applies to multiple robots as well.

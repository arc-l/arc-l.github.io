       For tabletop rearrangement problems with overhand grasps, storage space outside the tabletop workspace, or buffers, can temporarily hold objects which greatly facilitates
the resolution of a given rearrangement task. This brings forth the natural question of how many running buffers are required so that certain classes of tabletop rearrangement problems are feasible. We examine the problem for both the labeled and the unlabeledsettings. We observe that finding the minimum number of running buffers (MRB) can be carried out on a dependency graph abstracted from a problem instance, and show that computing MRB on dependency graphs is NP-hard. The number of required running buffers may grow unbounded as the number of objects to be rearranged increases even for uniform cylinders. On the algorithmic side, we develop highly effective algorithms for finding MRB for
both labeled and unlabeled tabletop rearrangement problems, scalable to over a hundred objects under very high object density. Employing these algorithms, empirical evaluations
show that random labeled and unlabeled instances, which more closely mimics real-world setups, have much smaller MRBs.
